## Hi there,

My theory is one can use enzyme to achieve the same e2e integration testing as with selenium browser tests.
I am looking to get feedback and all the things that are missing in this approach.

### Installation
make sure you have node > 7.0

inside main repo:
  ```npm install```

  ```cd ./frontend```
  ```npm install```


### Running
inside main repo:

```npm run api-server```

keep it running. in a different terminal window:

 ```cd ./frontend```
 ```npm start```
